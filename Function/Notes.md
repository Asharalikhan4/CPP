# function -
A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output.
The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.

# Basic syntax -
return_type function_name(parameter){
    //code
    return
}

- function using cin cout is not a good practise you should avoid it.

- function memory created and released automatically in stack. while in heap we have to do it manually.
