STL = standard template library.

1. Containers
- Sequence Container -> Linear fashion -> vector, List, Dequeue 
Vector -> fast random access -> slow deletion -> insertion/deletion at the end is fast.
List -> - slow random access -> fast insertion/deletion at middle/end.

- Associative Container -> Direct Access -> set, Multiset, map, multimap -> all operation are fast except random access.

- Derived Container -> derived from Sequence and Associative, used to represent real world modeling -> stack, queue, priority queue -> Depends.
